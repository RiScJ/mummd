# ```mummd```
Generate HTML from a personal markdown variant.

# *Mark-up my markdown*
I like HTML. I don't like writing HTML. 

Writing in markdown is faster, less visually busy, and generally less prone to annoying me. ```mummd``` is my personal solution. I use it to generate pages for my website from minimally-formatted documents written in a variant of markdown.
